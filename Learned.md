What I learned during Journey?

1. First, I create a C program and push to github and download locally in different location.
    While I try to run that pre-compiled file I got error called "Permission Denied". 
    Why I got this error?
        ==> Due to safety [not explaining details in technical terms just understand].
    How to solve?
        Run command to give executable permission by:
            chmod +x [name of compiled file]
                chmod = change mode, +x = executable permission
