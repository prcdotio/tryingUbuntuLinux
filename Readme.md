# Important!

I've created this repository just to get experience of github. It's not any C programming repository, I just picked C program just as part of test randomly.
It's on my own personal preference not following any official way.

One of more important point is that compiled files are individually visible while source code isn't available.
I decided it not to visible individually the source file. Here main.c single file is for every compiled source file
you can move to that commit to see the source code what was it. After every program written it is overwritten so
you can visit manually via commit id and you can easily determine via commit message
